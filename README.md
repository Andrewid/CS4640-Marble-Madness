# CS 4640 - Marble Madness
A near remake of the classic game

Player 1's controls are up-down-left-right


We had some issues with broken pre-fabs while learning to merge


had to re-design level 1 twice


The bars make a sound when bumped into


Goal makes a sound, but you can't hear it because it switches to the menu to quick


we'll fix that


as well as show you the score and transition you to the next level
